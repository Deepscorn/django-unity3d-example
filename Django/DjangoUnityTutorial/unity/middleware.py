    An Unity3D middleware which replaces the response status code with 200 
    and adds a REAL_STATUS_CODE header containing the original status code. 
    It also replaces the request method with the one specified in the 'UNITY_METHOD' 
    header field. 
    These modifications are necessary if you want to work with Unity's WWW class and 
    still keep the original Django RestFramework conventions.
